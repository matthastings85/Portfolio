  "Hi, my name is Matt. After spending over ten years learning dead languages (languages no one speaks), I decided to learn a few languages that are a little more lucrative. Yes, I can still parse your Ancient Hebrew verbs (or Greek or Akkadian or Aramaic), but you're probably more interested in my skills with ReactJS, SASS/CSS, and JavaScript.",
  "I grew up in South Africa but I've been living and working the USA for over 10 years. I have 13 years of experience in non-profit management. I built and lead teams to complete countless projects.",
  "At the beggining of 2021, my wife got a new job that eventually lead our family to move from South Carolina to Illinois. This move provided me with the opportunity to explore different vocational opportunities. My brother-in-law suggested I learn to code. He sent me a free online bootcamp by Frontend Masters. After completing that bootcamp I was hooked.",
  "I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I have focused specifically on ReactJS. I've had a lot of fun building projects and expanding my skills. It's been awesome to get feedback from some senior developers and I'm pumped about the progress I've made.",
  "I have recently gained DevOps skills, working with Docker, Jenkins, Linux, and Groovy. I excited to explore whatever opportunities come my way.",
